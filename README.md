A simple game.
Purpose of the game: Connect similar animal names.

Database is connected. If you want to launch, then firstly you need to create a database, and create a table called users (name varchar (45), score int NOT NULL, password varchar (45)). In order to enter with login and password, you should add 1 line of data (INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Nurs', 0, 'nurs1234')).
And after that we type the name of the host + db, the user of postgre and password inside of the "url, dbPassword, username" which is located in PostgreSQL.java.
Then we have to install postgresql-42.3.1.jar and sample inside of an empty java 8 project src file.
Then from intellij File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> + (bottom left) -> JARs or Directories -> choose postgresql-42.3.1.jar (look at Screenshot 1).
And we are good to go.
